# Grid UI Control Integration with Grid History

## Summary of Changes

This refactoring puts the grid-ui functionality under the control of the grid-history system, providing centralized state management and operation control for all grid manipulations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Grid History Manager (`grid-history.ts`)

**New Features:**

- **Enhanced State Capture**: Now captures row heights and grid styles in addition to innerHTML and column widths
- **Operation Control**: Added `executeOperation()` method that handles all UI operations with automatic state saving
- **UI Operation Types**: Added `UIOperation` type for standardized operation handling
- **Grid Management**: Added methods to attach/detach grids to/from history management
- **Operation Prevention**: Added `operationInProgress` flag to prevent nested operations

**New Methods:**

- `executeOperation(grid, operation, params)` - Central method for executing all grid operations
- `attachGrid(grid)` / `detachGrid(grid)` - Grid registration management
- `isAttached(grid)` - Check if grid is under history control
- Private operation methods: `resizeColumn()`, `resizeRow()`, `addRow()`, `addColumn()`, `removeRow()`, `removeColumn()`

### 2. Refactored Grid UI (`grid-ui.ts`)

**Architecture Changes:**

- **History Integration**: UI now works through grid-history for all state changes
- **Improved Drag State**: Enhanced drag state tracking with operation prevention
- **Preview + Commit Pattern**: UI operations now use a preview-during-drag, commit-on-release pattern
- **Automatic Registration**: Grid UI automatically registers grids with history manager

**Key Improvements:**

- **Operation Threshold**: Added 3px movement threshold to prevent accidental operations
- **Better State Management**: Drag operations track more state for precise control
- **Clean Separation**: UI handles user interaction, history handles state management
- **Proper Cleanup**: Enhanced attach/detach methods with proper cleanup

### 3. Simplified Grid Operations (`grid-operations.ts`)

**Simplification:**

- **Removed Manual State Saving**: All operations now use `gridHistoryManager.executeOperation()`
- **Cleaner API**: Operations are now simple function calls that delegate to history manager
- **Consistent Pattern**: All operations follow the same pattern through history manager

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. **Centralized Control**

- All grid modifications go through the history manager
- Consistent state saving and operation tracking
- Single source of truth for grid state

### 2. **Better User Experience**

- Live preview during drag operations
- Proper operation thresholds prevent accidental changes
- Enhanced undo/redo with more detailed state capture

### 3. **Improved Code Organization**

- Clear separation of concerns (UI handles interaction, history handles state)
- Easier to extend with new operations
- More maintainable codebase

### 4. **Enhanced State Management**

- Captures more comprehensive grid state
- Prevents operation conflicts with locking mechanism
- Better restoration of complex grid states

## Usage

The API remains the same for external consumers:

```typescript
// UI attachment (now automatically registers with history)
gridUI.attach(gridElement);

// Operations (now go through history manager)
addRow(grid);
addColumn(grid);
removeLastRow(grid);

// History operations remain the same
canUndo();
getLastOperation();
undoLastOperation(grid);
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Operation Flow:

1. User initiates action (drag, button click)
2. UI captures intent and starts preview
3. On completion, UI calls `gridHistoryManager.executeOperation()`
4. History manager saves current state, then executes operation
5. Operation is committed to DOM with full state tracking

### State Restoration:

- Enhanced state capture includes row heights and grid styles
- Restoration now properly rebuilds complex grid configurations
- Better handling of dynamic content and styling

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for future enhancements while maintaining backward compatibility and improving the overall user experience.
