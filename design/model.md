# Bloom Grid DOM Model

This document defines the current DOM data-\* model used by Bloom Grid, the goals it satisfies, and how it renders at runtime.

## 1) Requirements (goals and constraints)

- Single source of truth in `data-*` attributes (grid + cells).
- Deterministic, testable renderer that derives inline styles from the model.
- Clear, minimal public API for manipulating structure and styling.
- No visual conflicts: with zero gap between cells, at most one visible stroke is painted per shared edge (deterministic tie-breaks favor left/top).
- Support gaps/indents: when a positive gap exists between tracks, each side can draw independently.
- Perimeter borders: outer edges (top/right/bottom/left) set directly on the grid perimeter.
- Defaults: optional grid-level default edge used when an edge is unspecified.
- Spans: cell spans suppress internal edges and apply border segments at the span’s outer perimeter.
- Be concise. For example, don't require us list out specs for each edge when the are all the same. Another example: don't list color:"black" if you know that black is the default. This makes the html much easier to read an reason about.
  - UI must not compute defaults on its own. It should query centralized helpers that build upon the renderer (e.g., `border-state.ts`) to present current state.

## Approach

- Single source of truth for borders: edges belong to the parent grid, not cells.
- When gap between cells is 0, no conflict are possible because we specify every edge.
- When gap > 0, now we have multiple "borders" per "edge". At that point we have to specify east/west or north/south to define each border.
- Grid and cell state lives in `data-*` attributes only. No UI writes to `style` or CSS vars directly.
- Inline styles are render outputs, never inputs.

## Rendering Borders vs Outlines

- CSS borders have curved outsides but right-angle insides and look ugly. However, CSS Outlines are not a total replacement, because we cannot specify different sides to have different outlines, the way we can with borders. Perhaps in the future we will have a hybrid system, but for now, we are going to only use css borders, no outlines.

## 2) Data-\* schema

Terminology:

Grid sizing:

Cell sizing and content:

- `data-span-x`, `data-span-y`: integers ≥ 1 (default 1) indicating column/row span for a cell
- `data-content-type`: `text | image | grid` (existing)

- Spans: internal edges under a spanning cell are suppressed; only the span’s perimeter edges render. Covered cells retain DOM presence with class `skip`; the renderer avoids painting borders for `skip` cells and attributes the shared edges to the spanning owner.

Corners:

- Grid corners: `data-corners` on the grid is a JSON object, e.g., `{ "radius": number }`, that applies to the four outer grid corners.
- Cell corners (optional): cells may have `data-corners` as JSON `{ radius?: number }`. Outer corner radii of perimeter cells are forced to match the grid’s corner radius. Inner cell corners remain unrounded (0) unless future rules specify otherwise.

Nested grids:

- Where a nested grid sits inside a parent cell, the parent grid’s perimeter takes precedence over the nested grid’s perimeter where they coincide (the parent cell defines the visual outer boundary).

- `data-gap-x`: comma list or single CSS length for column gaps (C-1 entries if list)
- `data-gap-y`: comma list or single CSS length for row gaps (R-1 entries if list)

Unified edges (no separate outer object):

- `data-edges-h`: JSON 2D array describing horizontal boundaries. Preferred full shape is (R+1)×C; row 0 is the top perimeter, row R is the bottom perimeter; interior rows are boundaries between r and r+1.
- `data-edges-v`: JSON 2D array describing vertical boundaries. Preferred full shape is R×(C+1); col 0 is the left perimeter, col C is the right perimeter; interior cols are boundaries between c and c+1.

Authoring forms per entry (applies to both H and V arrays):

1. Shorthand single edge: `BorderSpec | null` (applies to both sides when gap is zero; `null` = unspecified)
2. Sided object for gaps/asymmetry:
   - Horizontal: `{ north?: BorderSpec|null, south?: BorderSpec|null }`
   - Vertical: `{ west?: BorderSpec|null, east?: BorderSpec|null }`

Concise interior-only form:

- For convenience, you may omit perimeters and provide only interior boundaries:
  - `data-edges-h`: shape (R-1)×C
  - `data-edges-v`: shape R×(C-1)
- You may also use a single interior row/col (length 1) in degenerate cases, e.g., a 1×2 grid.
- Perimeter edges are treated as absent unless explicitly provided (no implicit defaults beyond `data-border-default`).

Defaults:

- `data-border-default`: `BorderSpec | null`
  - If present, this is the default border spec the renderer uses when an edge side is unspecified.
  - If absent, the renderer reads CSS custom properties from the grid element (themeable):
    - `--edge-default-weight` (number, px)
    - `--edge-default-style` (solid|dashed|dotted|double|none)
    - `--edge-default-color` (CSS color)
  - These CSS vars can be defined globally (e.g., in :root) or overridden per-grid.

Null semantics (vs. explicit none):

- `null` means "unspecified" — the model provides no instruction for that boundary. It does not force absence; it simply omits a value.
  - Interior edges, zero gap: if both sides are unspecified, the default applies (from data-border-default or CSS vars). Conflicts choose a single stroke (none > weight > style; ties favor left/top).
  - Interior edges, positive gap: each side paints independently. If a side is unspecified, the default applies to that side; explicit `style:"none"` continues to suppress.
  - Perimeter edges: when unspecified, the default applies to the outer cell sides.
- `{ "style": "none" }` is an explicit instruction to render no border. It always suppresses defaults and participates in conflict resolution ("none" wins).
- Summary: use `style: "none"` to force no stroke; use `null` to say nothing.

Examples:

- 1×2 with a red divider, no perimeter (concise interior-only V):
  - `data-edges-h='[[null,null]]'` <!-- (R-1)×C = 0×2 effectively omitted -->
  - `data-edges-v='[[{"weight":1,"style":"solid","color":"red"}]]'` <!-- R×(C-1) = 1×1 -->
- 2×2 with only an outer 1px solid black border (full H/V with perimeters):
  - `data-edges-h='[[{"weight":1,"style":"solid","color":"#000"},{"weight":1,"style":"solid","color":"#000"}],[null,null],[{"weight":1,"style":"solid","color":"#000"},{"weight":1,"style":"solid","color":"#000"}]]'`
  - `data-edges-v='[[{"weight":1,"style":"solid","color":"#000"},null,{"weight":1,"style":"solid","color":"#000"}],[{"weight":1,"style":"solid","color":"#000"},null,{"weight":1,"style":"solid","color":"#000"}]]'`
- 2×2 with no inner borders (concise interior-only):
  - `data-edges-h='[[{"style":"none"},{"style":"none"}]]'` <!-- (R-1)×C = 1×2 -->
  - `data-edges-v='[[{"style":"none"}],[{"style":"none"}]]'` <!-- R×(C-1) = 2×1 -->
- 2×2 with inner red lines (shorthand):
  - `data-edges-v='[[{"color":"red"}],[{"color":"red"}]]'` <!-- R×(C-1) = 2×1; defaults: 1 solid -->
  - `data-edges-h='[[{"color":"red"},{"color":"red"}]]'` <!-- (R-1)×C = 1×2; defaults: 1 solid -->

CSS default example (no data-border-default provided):

```css
:root {
  --edge-default-weight: 1;
  --edge-default-style: solid;
  --edge-default-color: #000;
}
```

With the above, a 2×2 grid with no edges specified will render with 1px solid black on all inner edges and perimeters.

Behavior notes:

- Zero gap: each shared edge yields a single visible stroke by conflict resolution (none > weight > style precedence; ties favor left/top). Sided entries are reconciled; shorthand applies identically to both sides.
- Positive gap: both sides may render independently; sided entries allow asymmetric styling.
- Spans: internal edges under a spanning cell are suppressed; only the span’s perimeter edges render.

## 3) Rendering at runtime

At runtime, the renderer reads the above data-\* attributes, builds a per-cell border model, and sets standard CSS properties (e.g., `borderTopWidth/Style/Color`) on each cell. No structural mutations occur, and the grid template (columns/rows) is applied via CSS grid.
